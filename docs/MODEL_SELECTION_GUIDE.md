## 🔄 When to Use Comparison Mode

### Scenarios for Multi-Model Comparison:

#### 1. **Unknown Document Type**
- **Situation**: First time processing a new document format
- **Recommendation**: Compare Docling + Surya to see which performs better
- **Benefit**: Identify the best model for future similar documents

#### 2. **Quality Assessment**
- **Situation**: Critical documents requiring highest accuracy
- **Recommendation**: Use all three models and compare results
- **Benefit**: Identify discrepancies and choose most accurate output

#### 3. **Complex Documents**
- **Situation**: Documents with mixed content (tables + formulas + multiple languages)
- **Recommendation**: Compare specialized models (MinerU for formulas + Surya for languages)
- **Benefit**: Leverage each model's strengths

#### 4. **Benchmark Testing**
- **Situation**: Evaluating models for regular document processing workflow
- **Recommendation**: Test representative sample with all models
- **Benefit**: Data-driven model selection for your use case

### Comparison Mode Best Practices:

```
✅ DO use comparison when:
- Processing unfamiliar document types
- Quality is critical over speed
- Document has mixed content types
- Establishing processing workflows
- Training/evaluating model performance

❌ DON'T use comparison when:
- Processing routine, familiar documents
- Speed is more important than optimal accuracy
- Document type clearly matches one model's strengths
- Processing large batches (use established best model)
```

## 📈 Performance Optimization Guide

### Speed vs. Quality Trade-offs

**For Maximum Speed:**
1. **Surya** - Fastest processing, good for bulk documents
2. Single model selection (avoid comparison mode)
3. Smaller document batches
4. Process during low-traffic hours

**For Maximum Quality:**
1. **MinerU** for scientific content
2. **Docling** for business documents  
3. Comparison mode for critical documents
4. Manual review of results

**For Balanced Performance:**
1. **Docling** as default for most documents
2. **Surya** for non-English or scanned content
3. **MinerU** only for scientific documents
4. Selective use of comparison mode

### Resource Management

**Memory Considerations:**
- **MinerU**: High memory usage - limit concurrent processing
- **Docling**: Medium memory usage - good for regular processing
- **Surya**: Low memory usage - best for batch processing

**Processing Time Planning:**
```
Document Size Guide:
• 1-5 pages: All models perform well
• 6-20 pages: Consider processing time (Surya fastest)
• 21-50 pages: Prioritize model choice, avoid comparison
• 50+ pages: Use fastest appropriate model only
